# SEAPIE

``SEAPIE`` stands for ``Scope Escaping Arbitrary Python Injection Executor``

You can call ``seapie()`` _anywhere_ in your code to open python interpeter like console that can edit global, local and any
other variable available in _any_ scope that is in the current call stack.

## Example

```
>>> import seapie
>>>
>>> def test():
...     x = 1
...     seapie.seapie()
...     print("new value of x is", x)
...
>>> test()
SEAPIE v0.4 type !help for SEAPIE help
>>> x = 2 # anow we change the value of x in scope of test()
>>> !exit
new value of x is 2
```

## Known issues

Assinging new completely variables via seapie prompt works but calling variable that has only been defined in seapie prompt
will result in NameError. You can try circumventing this by calling and parsing locals() to get your newly and hackily
assinged variable name and using exec() instead of directly calling the variable. Same goes for importing new modules as they
act like variables. So if you import datetime in seapie prompt you should call exec("print(datetime)") instead of calling
print(datetime) in your main program.

You most likely shouldn't structure your code to call variables that have been defined via interactive propmt only but you
can do it if you wish to shoot yourself in the foot.

## Todo
* Implement support for global variables
* Look for a way to allow assinging new variables and importing from seapie prompt without having to rely on exec() in main program
